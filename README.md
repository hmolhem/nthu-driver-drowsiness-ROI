# nthu-driver-drowsiness-ROI
Image-based driver drowsiness detection on the NTHU-DDD2 dataset with subject-exclusive splits. Explores ROI-aware CNNs using pseudo eye/mouth segmentation masks, compact backbones (ResNet/EfficientNet/VGG), and robustness to glare, blur, and eyelid occlusion. Includes clean manifests, train scripts, and reproducible experiments.
